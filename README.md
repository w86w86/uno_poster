## Poster Title: Real Incomes Have Increased For Nearly All Demographics - But Not Equally.
This repository is part of a semester project for the Data Visualization course at the University of Nebraska Omaha. It contains datasets, R code, and a notebook for visual analysis of income growth, income inequality, and poverty across various demographics and geographies in the United States.

## Data Visualization group 3 - Project Contributors:
- Abhinav Adhikari
- Brent Arnold
- Souleymane Diawara
- Fariba Mohammadi

## Abstract:
Our project explores the trends in real income growth, the disparities in income distribution, and the impact of these trends on different demographic groups and regions within the U.S. We aim to provide a graphical representation to understand who has benefited the most and the least from economic growth over the past decades.

## Repository Contents:
- `Data/`: Folder containing all the datasets used in our analyses.
- `Code/`: R scripts and functions developed for data processing and visualization.
- `Notebook/`: An R Notebook file that compiles all our visualizations and can be run to reproduce the analysis.
- `Poster/`: The final poster summarizing our findings and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Detailed information about the project, data sources, and instructions on how to execute the code.
- `Findings.md`: Detailed instructions on how to navigate the repository and utilize the resources provided.

## Visualizations:
1. Median Income Growth by Race (2002-2022)
